# Automatic Number Plate Recognition System (ANPR)

This project implements an **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** system using computer vision techniques and deep learning. The goal is to detect license plates from images of vehicles and extract their alphanumeric contents for further processing, such as vehicle tracking, access control, or surveillance.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Detects vehicle license plates from input images.
- Extracts and reads the number plate text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- Utilizes OpenCV for image pre-processing and localization.
- Uses Tesseract OCR for reading text from license plates.
- Supports both static image input and potential for real-time video feed integration.

## ðŸ§  Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Pytesseract
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
  
## ðŸ“· Sample Output
The notebook includes sample input images and displays output with the detected number plate and recognized text.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
Integration with live webcam or CCTV video stream.

Improved accuracy using deep learning models like YOLO for number plate detection.

Support for various number plate formats and languages.
